###  challenges

___Set up git on the computers
# git-githms
1) Learning about git commands :
    git clone enter-here-repository-url
    git add -A
    git commit -m "My custom message"
    git push


2) Installing Cmder.exe

# gitbook
3) Trying to use :
    build.sh    # to execute this file run this command in terminal:
                # chmod a+x ./publish.sh
    
    publish.sh  # to execute this file run this command in terminal:
                # chmod a+x ./publish.sh
    serve.sh
from scripts...

4) Installing gitbook
5) Installing npm package
    npm install -g name-of-package

6) JSON - data structure (Javascript Object Notation) - format przechowywania danych

7) Error with being unable to start gitbook serve

The issue was related to the gitbook error itself. 
The solution was to downgrade the nodejs to version 6.12 (https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/issues/1309) with gitbook version 2.6.7
For gitbook version 3.2.3 solution is to modify a file in {User}/.gitbook however it didn't work out for me.

To control versions for NodeJS in Windows, I have downloaded NVM, which is node version manager for Windows with super easy CLI.
